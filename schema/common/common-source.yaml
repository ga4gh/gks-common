  Entity:
    description: >-
      Entity is the root class of the 'gks-common' core information model classes - those that
      have identifiers and other general metadata like labels, xrefs, urls, descriptions, etc.
      All common classes descend from and inherit its attributes.
    heritableProperties:
      id:
        type: string
        description: >-
          The 'logical' identifier of the entity in the system of record, e.g. a UUID. This 'id' is
          unique within a given system. The identified entity may have a different 'id' in a different
          system, or may refer to an 'id' for the shared concept in another system (e.g. a CURIE).

  DomainEntity:
    inherits: Entity

      'Lung Cancer', not 'patient123's lung cancer'. Or 'Erlotinib', not the particular doses given to a
      patient on a specific occasion.

  RecordMetadata:
    type: object
    maturity: draft
    description: >-
      A reusable structure that encapsulates provenance metadata about a serialized data record or
      object in a particular dataset (as opposed to provenance about the real world entity this
      record or object represents).
    comment: >-
      Record-level metadata applies to a specific concrete encoding/serialization of information 
      (e.g as a record in a specific data/knowlegebase, or an online digital resource). 
      A RecordMetadata object can capture when, how, and by whom a specific record serialization was
      generated or modified; what upstream resources it was derived or retrieved from; and record-level 
      administrative information such as versioning and lifecycle status. RecordMetadata objects should 
      not be used to describe provenance of the abstract information content or knowledge captured in a 
      data record or object - other properties in the model are defined to support this use case. 
    properties:
      recordIdentifier:
        type: string
        description: >-
          The identifier of the data record or object described in this RecordMetadata object.

        type: string
        description: >-
          Another data record from which the record described here was derived, through a data 
          ingest and/or transformation process. Value should be a string representing the identifier
          of the source record.
      dateRecordCreated:
        type: string
        format: datetime
        description: The date the record was initially created.
      contributions:
        type: array
        ordered: false
        items:
          $ref: '#/$defs/Contribution'

          (e.g. 'Sequence Ontology'), but it is preferable to provide a uri/url for the system.
          When the 'code' is reported as a CURIE, the 'system' should be reported as the uri that
          the CURIE's prefix expands to (e.g. 'http://purl.obofoundry.org/so.owl/' for the
          Sequence Ontology).
      version:
        type: string
        description: Version of the terminology or code system that provided the code.

        description: >-
          A symbol uniquely identifying the concept, as in a syntax defined by the code system.
          CURIE format is preferred where possible (e.g. 'SO:0000704' is the CURIE form of the
          Sequence Ontology code for 'gene').
