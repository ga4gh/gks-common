  Entity:
    description: Anything that exists, has existed, or will exist.
    comment: >-
      Entity is the root class of the 'gks-common' core information model. All common classes that
      have ids and other general metadata like label, description, type, or extensions descend from
      this class and inherit its attributes.
    heritableProperties:
      id:
        type: string
        description: >-
          The 'logical' identifier of the Entity in the system of record, e.g. a UUID.  This 'id' is
          unique within a given system, but may or may not be globally unique outside the system. It
          is used within a system to reference an object from another.
        comment: >-
          Note that it is common for implementers to create their own internal logical ids - 
          typically a serially or randomly generated value like a UUID that is assigned to the 
          data object as it is created in a system. But an implementer may choose to re-use an 
          existing, globally unique id from an external system or authority for this purpose 
          (e.g. an HGNC id for a Gene object) - as long as it is unique within the implementing 
          system, and can be used to reference the identified object in this context.
      type:
        type: string
        description: >-
          The name of the class that is instantiated by a data object representing the Entity.

          A list of extensions to the Entity, that allow for capture of information not directly
          supported by elements defined in the model. 
        comment: >-
          Extension objects have a key-value data structure that allows definition of custom
          fields in the data itself. Extensions are not expected to be natively understood, 
          but may be used for pre-negotiated exchange of message attributes between systems.

  DomainEntity:
    inherits: Entity
    description: >-
      An Entity that is specific to a particular biomedical domain such as disease, therapeutics, or genes.
      Domain Entities are considered as 'concept-level' entities, as opposed to particular instances. e.g.
      'Lung Cancer', not 'patient123's lung cancer'. Or 'Erlotinib', not the particular doses given to a
      patient on a specific occasion.

          include a coding and a relation.

  InformationEntity:
    inherits: Entity
    description: >-
      An abstract (non-physical) entity that is about something. It represents the abstract 'information content'
      conveyed by physical or digital information artifacts like books, web pages, data tables, or photographs.
    comments: >-
      Information Entities represent the abstract 'information content' that can be concretized in 
      physical or digital artifacts such as books, photographs, files, web pages, the neural connections 
      of a human brain, etc. They are independent of any specific language, representational format, or 
      physical/digital medium, and can be simultaneously concretized in many distinct physical artifacts 
      (e.g. all physical copies of the first edition of "War and Peace" carry the same information content, 
      and thus concretize the same Information Entity).

          The term 'authored' is used in the model to refer to the generation of abstract 'information content', as 
          opposed to creation of a concrete encoding of this information in a specific language, format, or 
          physical artifact. e.g. for a Statement, this attribute captures when the information content expressed 
          in the Statement was first generated by an agent, and metadata about when a particular concrete encoding
          of this information was created (e.g. a written sentence in an article, or json object in a data stream) 
          would live in a RecordMetadata object attached to the Information Entity).

          This attribute holds a structured RecordMetadata object, which can be used to capture when, how, and

          from; and record-level administrative information such as versioning and lifecycle status.

    comment: >-
      Record-level metadata applies to a specific concrete encoding/serialization of information
      (e.g as a record in a specific data/knowlegebase, or an online digital resource).
      A RecordMetadata object can capture when, how, and by whom a specific record serialization was
      generated or modified; what upstream resources it was derived or retrieved from; and record-level
      administrative information such as versioning and lifecycle status. RecordMetadata objects should
      not be used to describe provenance of the abstract information content or knowledge captured in a
      data record or object - other properties in the model are defined to support this use case.

  #     The abstract entity representing a possible fact that may be put forth as true, or subjected to

  #     are independent of space and time, and whether they are ever asserted to be true by some agent.
  #     Propositions may be used in two contexts; (1) by Statements that assert them to be true or false,
  #     or describe the overall level of confidence/evidence for or against them; (2) by Evidence Lines that
  #     report the direction and strength of an evidence-based argument for the Proposition.
