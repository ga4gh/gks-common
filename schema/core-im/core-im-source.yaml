$defs:
  Entity:
    description: >-
      Entity is the root class of the 'gks-common' core information model classes - those that
      have identifiers and other general metadata like labels, xrefs, urls, descriptions, etc.
      All common classes descend from and inherit its attributes.
    heritableProperties:
      id:
        type: string
        description: >-
          The 'logical' identifier of the entity in the system of record, e.g. a UUID. This 'id' is
          unique within a given system. The identified entity may have a different 'id' in a different
          system, or may refer to an 'id' for the shared concept in another system (e.g. a CURIE).
      label:
        type: string
        description: A primary name for the entity.
      description:
        type: string
        description: A free-text description of the entity.
      alternativeLabels:
        type: array
        ordered: false
        items:
          type: string
        description: Alternative name(s) for the Entity.
      extensions:
        type: array
        ordered: true
        items:
          $ref: "#/$defs/Extension"
        description: >-
          A list of extensions to the entity. Extensions are not expected to be natively understood,
          but may be used for pre-negotiated exchange of message attributes between systems.

  DomainEntity:
    inherits: Entity
    description: >-
      An Entity that is specific to a particular biomedical domain such as disease, therapeutics, or genes.
      Domain Entities are considered as 'concept-level' entities, as opposed to particular instances. e.g.
      'Lung Cancer', not 'patient123's lung cancer'. Or 'Erlotinib', not the particular doses given to a
      patient on a specific occasion.
    heritableProperties:

          $ref: "#/$defs/ConceptMapping"
        description: >-
          A list of mappings to concepts in terminologies or code systems. Each mapping should
          include a coding and a relation.
    heritableRequired:

      deprecation of a particular entity (e.g. a Statement, EvidenceLine, DataItem, Publication, etc.)
    properties:
      type:
        type: string

  Agent:
    type: object
    inherits: Entity
    maturity: draft
    description: >-
      An autonomous actor (person, organization, or computational agent) that bears some form
      of responsibility for an activity taking place, for the existence of an entity, or for
      another agent's activity.
    properties:
      type:
        type: string

  RecordMetadata:
    type: object
    maturity: draft
    description: >-
      A reusable structure that encapsulates provenance metadata about a serialized data record or
      object in a particular dataset (as opposed to provenance about the real world entity this
      record or object represents).
    comment: >-
      Record-level metadata applies to a specific concrete encoding/serialization of information 
      (e.g as a record in a specific data/knowlegebase, or an online digital resource). 
      A RecordMetadata object can capture when, how, and by whom a specific record serialization was
      generated or modified; what upstream resources it was derived or retrieved from; and record-level 
      administrative information such as versioning and lifecycle status. RecordMetadata objects should 
      not be used to describe provenance of the abstract information content or knowledge captured in a 
      data record or object - other properties in the model are defined to support this use case. 
    properties:
      recordIdentifier:
        type: string
        description: >-
          The identifier of the data record or object described in this RecordMetadata object.
      recordVersion:
        type: string
        description: The version number of the record-level artifact the object describes.
      derivedFrom:
        type: string
        description: >-
          Another data record from which the record described here was derived, through a data 
          ingest and/or transformation process. Value should be a string representing the identifier
          of the source record.
      dateRecordCreated:
        type: string
        format: datetime
        description: The date the record was initially created.
      contributions:
        type: array
        ordered: false
        items:
          $ref: '#/$defs/Contribution'
        description: >-
          Describes specific contributions made by an human or software agent to the creation,
          modification, or administrative management of a data record or object.

  Coding:
    type: object
    maturity: draft
    description: >-

    properties:
      label:
        type: string
        description: The human-readable name for the coded concept, as defined by the code system.
      system:

        description: >-
          The terminology/code system that defined the code. May be reported as a free-text name
          (e.g. 'Sequence Ontology'), but it is preferable to provide a uri/url for the system.
          When the 'code' is reported as a CURIE, the 'system' should be reported as the uri that
          the CURIE's prefix expands to (e.g. 'http://purl.obofoundry.org/so.owl/' for the
          Sequence Ontology).
      version:
        type: string
        description: Version of the terminology or code system that provided the code.
      code:
        $ref: '#/$defs/Code'
        description: >-
          A symbol uniquely identifying the concept, as in a syntax defined by the code system.
          CURIE format is preferred where possible (e.g. 'SO:0000704' is the CURIE form of the
          Sequence Ontology code for 'gene').
    required:
      - system
      - code

  ConceptMapping:
    type: object
    maturity: draft

  Extension:
    type: object
    maturity: draft
    description: >-
      The Extension class provides entities with a means to include
      additional attributes that are outside of the specified standard
      but needed by a given content provider or system implementer.
      These extensions are not expected to be natively understood, but
      may be used for pre-negotiated exchange of message attributes
      between systems.
    properties:
      name:
        type: string
        description: >-
          A name for the Extension. Should be indicative of its meaning and/or the type of
          information it value represents.

  Code:
    maturity: draft
    description: >-
      Indicates that the value is taken from a set of controlled strings defined elsewhere.
      Technically, a code is restricted to a string which has at least one character and no leading or
      trailing whitespace, and where there is no whitespace other than single spaces in the contents.
    type: string
    pattern: '\S+( \S+)*'
    example: ENSG00000139618

  IRI:
