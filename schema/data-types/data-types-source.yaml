  Coding:
    type: object
    maturity: draft
    description: >-
      A structured representation of a code for a defined concept in a terminology or code system.
    properties:
      label:
        type: string
        description: The human-readable name for the coded concept, as defined by the code system.
      system:
        type: string
        description: >-
          The terminology/code system that defined the code. May be reported as a free-text name
          (e.g. 'Sequence Ontology'), but it is preferable to provide a uri/url for the system.
          When the 'code' is reported as a CURIE, the 'system' should be reported as the uri that
          the CURIE's prefix expands to (e.g. 'http://purl.obofoundry.org/so.owl/' for the
          Sequence Ontology).
      systemVersion:
        type: string
        description: Version of the terminology or code system that provided the code.
      code:
        $ref: '#/$defs/Code'
        description: >-
          A symbol uniquely identifying the concept, as in a syntax defined by the code system.
          CURIE format is preferred where possible (e.g. 'SO:0000704' is the CURIE form of the
          Sequence Ontology code for 'gene').
    required:
      - system
      - code

  ConceptMapping:
    type: object
    maturity: draft
    description: >-
      A mapping to a concept in a terminology or code system.
    properties:
      coding:
        $ref: '#/$defs/Coding'
        description: >-
          A structured representation of a code for a defined concept in a terminology or code system.
      relation:
        description: >-
          A mapping relation between concepts as defined by the Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS).
        type: string
        enum:
          - closeMatch
          - exactMatch
          - broadMatch
          - narrowMatch
          - relatedMatch
    required:
      - relation
      - coding

  Extension:
    type: object
    maturity: draft
    description: >-
      The Extension class provides entities with a means to include
      additional attributes that are outside of the specified standard
      but needed by a given content provider or system implementer.
      These extensions are not expected to be natively understood, but
      may be used for pre-negotiated exchange of message attributes
      between systems.
    properties:
      name:
        type: string
        description: >-
          A name for the Extension. Should be indicative of its meaning and/or the type of
          information it value represents.
      value:
        type: [ "number", "string", "boolean", "object", "array", "null" ]
        description: The value of the Extension - can be any primitive or structured object
        additionalProperties: true
      description:
        type: string
        description: >-
          A description of the meaning or utility of the Extension, to explain
          the type of information it is meant to hold.
    required:
      - name
      - value

  Code:    
    type: string
    maturity: draft
    description: >-
      Indicates that the value is taken from a set of controlled strings defined elsewhere.
      Technically, a code is restricted to a string which has at least one character and no leading or
      trailing whitespace, and where there is no whitespace other than single spaces in the contents.
    pattern: '\S+( \S+)*'
    example: ENSG00000139618

  IRI:
    type: string
    maturity: draft
    description: >-
      An IRI Reference (either an IRI or a relative-reference), according to `RFC3986 section 4.1
      <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986#section-4.1>`_ and `RFC3987 section 2.1
      <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3987#section-2.1>`_. MAY be a JSON Pointer as an IRI fragment, as
      described by `RFC6901 section 6 <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6901#section-6>`_.
    format: iri-reference
