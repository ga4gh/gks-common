    description: >-
      Entity is the root class of ‘core’ classes model - those that have identifiers and other general 
      metadata like labels, xrefs, urls, descriptions, etc. All core classes descend from and inherit 
      its attributes.
    heritableProperties:
      id:
        type: string
        description: >-
          The 'logical' identifier of the entity in the system of record, e.g. a UUID. This 'id' is 
          unique within a given system. The identified entity may have a different 'id' in a different 
          system, or may refer to an 'id' for the shared concept in another system (e.g. a CURIE).

      used for pre-negotiated exchange of message attributes when needed.
